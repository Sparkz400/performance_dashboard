# Dependency PR disposition — 2026-10-26

All 29 open proposals were reviewed against the current root-workspace project.
Compatible changes are consolidated into the P0 implementation so one dependency
set can be installed and tested together. Original bot branches are retained as
review provenance when their commits were not merged verbatim.

| PR | Disposition |
| --- | --- |
| [#1](https://github.com/Sparkz400/performance_dashboard/pull/1) | The Docker login action was used only by the removed preview workflow. Current workflows do not call docker/login-action, so this obsolete patch has no target. |
| [#3](https://github.com/Sparkz400/performance_dashboard/pull/3) | The current CI and security workflows already use actions/upload-artifact v7 with a pinned commit. This older v7 proposal is superseded by main. |
| [#6](https://github.com/Sparkz400/performance_dashboard/pull/6) | The github-script usage targeted by this PR was removed with the old preview/CI implementation. Current workflows contain no github-script step. |
| [#8](https://github.com/Sparkz400/performance_dashboard/pull/8) | Defer the MUI 6 to 7 migration: existing Grid2 imports and associated components require coordinated API and browser validation. The P0 work retains one consistent MUI 6 family. Tracked in TODO F09's dependency follow-up. |
| [#12](https://github.com/Sparkz400/performance_dashboard/pull/12) | Defer the coordinated lint major migration. Installed eslint-plugin-react 7.37.5 supports ESLint through ^9.7, not 10. Retain ESLint 9 until the plugin/config migration is compatible and validated. Tracked in TODO F09. |
| [#13](https://github.com/Sparkz400/performance_dashboard/pull/13) | Do not install React Window 2 typings over the retained react-window 1.8 runtime. Runtime, types and virtualization callers must migrate together. Tracked in TODO F09. |
| [#14](https://github.com/Sparkz400/performance_dashboard/pull/14) | Consolidated into this change and superseded after integration. |
| [#15](https://github.com/Sparkz400/performance_dashboard/pull/15) | Defer react-grid-layout 2 until dashboard persistence, drag/resize behavior and API/type changes can be migrated together. This P0 wave retains the tested v1 layout contract. Tracked in TODO F09. |
| [#16](https://github.com/Sparkz400/performance_dashboard/pull/16) | This updates only @storybook/react to 10 while storybook, addons, blocks and the Vite adapter remain 8. Defer the family migration together with Vite compatibility. Tracked in TODO F09. |
| [#17](https://github.com/Sparkz400/performance_dashboard/pull/17) | The installed @storybook/react-vite 8.6.18 declares Vite ^4 || ^5 || ^6. Vite 8 alone is incompatible; coordinate the Storybook/Vite migration. Tracked in TODO F09. |
| [#18](https://github.com/Sparkz400/performance_dashboard/pull/18) | Consolidated into this change and superseded after integration. |
| [#19](https://github.com/Sparkz400/performance_dashboard/pull/19) | Consolidated into this change and superseded after integration. |
| [#20](https://github.com/Sparkz400/performance_dashboard/pull/20) | This upgrades only the Storybook Vite adapter to 10 while the remaining Storybook packages remain 8. Coordinate the entire family and Vite upgrade. Tracked in TODO F09. |
| [#21](https://github.com/Sparkz400/performance_dashboard/pull/21) | Defer AutoSizer 2 with the coordinated React Window virtualization migration so the sizing contract and actual list rendering can be tested together. Tracked in TODO F09. |
| [#23](https://github.com/Sparkz400/performance_dashboard/pull/23) | Consolidated into this change and superseded after integration. |
| [#24](https://github.com/Sparkz400/performance_dashboard/pull/24) | Consolidated into this change and superseded after integration. |
| [#25](https://github.com/Sparkz400/performance_dashboard/pull/25) | Consolidated into this change and superseded after integration. |
| [#26](https://github.com/Sparkz400/performance_dashboard/pull/26) | Consolidated into this change and superseded after integration. |
| [#29](https://github.com/Sparkz400/performance_dashboard/pull/29) | The repository explicitly supports and tests Node.js 24 (.nvmrc, AGENTS.md, CI and Docker). Keep the runtime consistent; a Node 26 migration needs a separate support decision and complete validation. Tracked in TODO F09. |
| [#30](https://github.com/Sparkz400/performance_dashboard/pull/30) | Consolidated into this change and superseded after integration. |
| [#31](https://github.com/Sparkz400/performance_dashboard/pull/31) | Consolidated into this change and superseded after integration. |
| [#32](https://github.com/Sparkz400/performance_dashboard/pull/32) | Consolidated into this change and superseded after integration. |
| [#33](https://github.com/Sparkz400/performance_dashboard/pull/33) | Consolidated into this change and superseded after integration. |
| [#34](https://github.com/Sparkz400/performance_dashboard/pull/34) | Consolidated into this change and superseded after integration. |
| [#35](https://github.com/Sparkz400/performance_dashboard/pull/35) | eslint-plugin-react 7.37.5 declares support through ESLint ^9.7, not 10; an isolated ESLint 10 bump cannot form a supported dependency set. Track the coordinated lint migration in TODO F09. |
| [#36](https://github.com/Sparkz400/performance_dashboard/pull/36) | This bumps Vitest to 5 without moving its matching @vitest/coverage-v8 peer. The current consolidation keeps Vitest and coverage on the same v4 release; a v5 migration is deferred in TODO F09. |
| [#37](https://github.com/Sparkz400/performance_dashboard/pull/37) | Consolidated into this change and superseded after integration. |
| [#38](https://github.com/Sparkz400/performance_dashboard/pull/38) | Consolidated into this change and superseded after integration. |
| [#39](https://github.com/Sparkz400/performance_dashboard/pull/39) | This upgrades MUI icons to 9 while Material and System stay on 6. Retain a consistent MUI family and migrate components together, tracked in TODO F09. |

## Consolidation details

- PR 32 is subsumed by the newer PostgreSQL instrumentation in PR 34. OpenTelemetry API 1.10/resources and metrics SDK 3 are aligned with SDK Node/exporters 0.300, removing invalid peer dependencies. A real loopback span export verifies startup and shutdown.
- PR 33 becomes Vitest 4.1.12 with the matching coverage provider. PR 36's isolated v5 upgrade is not applied.
- PRs 23–26 are included through the regenerated root lock: YAML 2.9.1 (and 1.10.3 where required), patched picomatch, socket.io-parser 4.2.7 and flatted 3.4.4.
- PRs 30/31 use their exact pinned setup-node and Trivy action commits. Node 24 remains the supported application runtime.
- PR 34 is applied to current manifests without reverting earlier security fixes. The scheduler uses node-cron's exported ScheduledTask type. npm's old-lock resolver crashed, so the root workspace lock was resolved from the current manifests and validated with a clean install; no legacy-peer-deps or force flag is required.
- Future major proposals group MUI, Storybook/Vite, lint, Vitest/coverage and virtualization families so coupled changes can be reviewed together.

## Security residuals and ownership

The local runtime-only npm audit reports **zero advisories**. The full audit
reports **seven moderate package findings**, stemming from two development-only
advisories: [esbuild development-server access](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99)
through drizzle-kit, and [UUID behavior](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-w5hq-g745-h8pq)
through Storybook addon-actions. Proposed npm fixes downgrade whole toolchains;
they are not applied blindly. Do not expose development/Storybook/database tooling
to untrusted networks. Repository maintainers own these residuals under F09;
review supported upstream migrations and rerun audits for each release.

Container/Chromium advisories and code scanning are separate gates, reported by
the current-image workflow. This record does not accept an image for production.
See [P0 acceptance](P0_ACCEPTANCE.md) and [TODO](../TODO.md).
